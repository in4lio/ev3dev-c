### VERSION

    ev3dev-c    1.0c3
                2019-01-27

    kernel      4.4.87-22-ev3dev-ev3

### WHAT IS IT?

**ev3dev-c** is a C library for [LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Debian Linux][ev3dev]
which wraps access to the EV3 hardware.

The library also supports remote access to the EV3 brick over a network.
So, if you [configure WLAN][ev3dev-net] on the brick, you can control
the EV3 hardware from a remote computer, for example, running under Windows.

### GETTING STARTED

Before you start, make sure that you have opened an [SSH connection][ev3dev-ssh]
to your EV3 brick.

You need to install the compiler and other tools:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install build-essential
    sudo apt-get install git

Then, clone the library repository and its submodules to the directory
of your choice, such as _"/home/robot/ev3dev-c"_:

    cd /home/robot/
    git clone https://github.com/in4lio/ev3dev-c.git
    cd ev3dev-c/
    git submodule update --init --recursive

Compile and install static and shared libraries:

    cd source/ev3/
    make
    sudo make install
    make shared
    sudo make shared-install

It's the right time to take a look at a small example. [_"hello.c"_][hello.c]
outputs a greeting as well as toggles the left LED color:

    cd ../../eg/hello/
    more ./hello.c

Let's compile and run this program. Note that we link our example with
a static library:

    gcc hello.c -lev3dev-c -o hello
    ./hello

### PYTHON, RUBY and PERL

[Python](python), [Ruby](ruby) and [Perl](perl) libraries are
automatically generated from the C library using SWIG tool.

Use **pip** to install **ev3dev-c** Python package:

    pip install ev3dev-c

**ev3dev-c** Python package contains the following binary modules:
* _"\_ev3.pyd"_ – for remote control from Windows (x86)
* _"\_ev3.so"_ – for LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Debian

You have to install _"python-dev"_, _"ruby-dev"_ and _"libperl-dev"_
packages to build the corresponding libraries.

### GET HELP

[Documentation generated by Doxygen](http://in4lio.github.io/ev3dev-c/)

### FAQ

#### What are unusual _".yu"_, _".yu-с"_ and _".yu-h"_ files for?

**ev3dev-c** is written using [yupp lexical preprocessor][yupp] –
but don't panic – the generated source files in C also included.

You have to take into account that, by default, the preprocessing stage
is skipping when compilation is performed on the brick or using Docker.
Please set `SKIP_PP = 0` in the makefile to allow preprocessing anywhere.
