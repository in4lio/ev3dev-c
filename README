    ___             ______________________________
    ___ WHAT IS IT? ______________________________

    ev3dev-c is a C library for LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Debian Linux
    (http://www.ev3dev.org/) which wraps access to the EV3 hardware.

    The library also supports remote access to the EV3 brick over a network.
    So, if you configure WLAN on the brick, you can control the EV3 hardware
    from a remote computer, for example, running under Windows.

    ___                 __________________________
    ___ GETTING STARTED __________________________

    Before you start, make sure that you have opened an SSH connection
    to your EV3 brick.

    You need to install the compiler and other tools:

        sudo apt-get update
        sudo apt-get install build-essential
        sudo apt-get install git

    Then, clone the library repository and its submodules to the directory
    of your choice, such as "/home/robot/ev3dev-c":

        cd /home/robot/
        git clone https://github.com/in4lio/ev3dev-c.git
        cd ev3dev-c/
        git submodule update --init --recursive

    Compile and install static and shared libraries:

        cd source/ev3/
        make
        sudo make install
        make shared
        sudo make shared-install

    It's the right time to take a look at a small example. "hello.c" outputs
    a greeting as well as toggles the left LED color:

        cd ../../eg/hello/
        more ./hello.c

    Let's compile and run this program. Note that we link our example with
    a static library:

        gcc hello.c -lev3dev-c -o hello
        ./hello

    ___ PYTHON, RUBY and PERL ____________________

    Python (see "python/ev3dev" folder), Ruby (see "ruby" folder) and
    Perl (see "perl" folder) libraries are automatically generated from
    C library using SWIG tool.

    Use pip to install ev3dev-c Python package:

        pip install ev3dev-c

    ev3dev-c Python package contains the following binary modules:
    _ev3.pyd    – for remote control from Windows (x86)
    _ev3.so     – for LEGO MINDSTORMS EV3 Debian.

    You have to install "python-dev", "ruby-dev" and "libperl-dev"
    packages to build the corresponding libraries.
