    ___ WHAT IS IT? ______________________________

    ev3dev-c is a C library for LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Debian
    (http://www.ev3dev.org/) which wraps an access to the EV3 hardware.

    The library also supports a remote access to the EV3 brick over UDP.
    So, if you set up WLAN on the brick you will be able to drive
    the EV3 hardware from your computer, e.g. under Windows.

    Python (see "python/ev3dev" folder), Ruby (see "ruby" folder) and
    Perl (see "perl" folder) libraries are automatically generated from
    C library using SWIG tool.

    Use pip to install ev3dev-c Python package:

        pip install --pre ev3dev-c

    ev3dev-c is currently in a beta stage, therefore you have to use
    the key "--pre".

    Python package contains the following binary modules:
    _ev3.pyd    – for a remote access, under Windows (x86);
    _ev3.so     – for LEGO Mindstorms EV3 Debian.

    You have to install "python-dev", "ruby-dev" and "libperl-dev"
    packages to build the corresponding library.
